            <br>
            <span class="desc">
                The field of autonomy is rapidly evolving, and recent advancements from the machine learning community, such as large language models (LLM) and world models, bring great potential. We believe the future lies in explainable, end-to-end models that understand the world and generalize to unvisited environments. In light of this, we propose seven new challenges that push the boundary of existing perception, prediction, and planning pipelines.

            <h2>Foundation Models for Autonomous Systems</h2>
            <br>
            <span class="desc">
                Autonomous systems, such as robots and self-driving cars, have rapidly evolved over the past decades. Recently, foundation models have emerged as a promising approach to building more generalist autonomous systems due to their ability to learn from vast amounts of data and generalize to new tasks. The motivation behind this workshop is to explore the potential of foundation models for autonomous agents and discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with this approach.

                In this tutorial, we explore the intersection of AGI technologies and the advancement of autonomous systems, specifically in the field of robotics. We invite participants to embark on an investigative journey that covers essential concepts, frameworks, and challenges. Through discussion, we aim to shed light on the crucial role of fundamental models in enhancing the cognitive abilities of autonomous agents. Through cooperation, we aim to chart a path for the future of robotics, where the integration of AGI enables autonomous systems to push the limits of their capabilities and intelligence, ushering in a new era of intelligent autonomy.

                Although the past century witnessed an unprecedented expansion of scientific and technological knowledge, there are concerns that innovative activity is slowing. It is not uncommon for individuals to compromise their personal research interests in order to fulfill academic obligations, such as funding, service, etc. Nevertheless, preserving one's research interests is crucial for fostering diversity in research.

        <p>
          In OpenLane-V2, we annotate lane centerlines and their connectivities to provide map-like results to facilitate downstream tasks.
          Moreover, traffic elements and their correspondences to lanes are critical for understanding the complex driving environment.
          Participants are required to deliver results on lanes, traffic elements, and topology relationships simultaneously.

        <p>
          Unlike previous perception representations, which depend on predefined geometric primitives or perceived data modalities, occupancy enjoys the flexibility to describe entities in arbitrary shapes.
          Based on the given images, participants are needed to provide the occupancy state and semantics of each voxel in 3D space for the complete scene.

          Previous benchmarks focus on short-term motion forecasting and are limited to open-loop evaluation.
          NuPlan introduces long-term planning of the ego vehicle and corresponding metrics.
          Provided as docker containers, submissions are deployed for simulation and evaluation.

                        <p itemprop="description" style="font-size: 1.2em;">We first define the task of recognizing
                          topology relationships in the field of autonomous driving.
                          Given multi-view images, the model learns to recognize the topology relationships among lane
                          centerlines and between lane centerlines and traffic elements.
                          In our case, both vertices and edges are unknown for the model.
                          Thus, lane centerlines and traffic elements are needed to be detected first, and then the
                          topology relationships are built.

IF YOU DO NOT MEET ALL OF THESE REQUIREMENTS OR ANY OTHER ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS IN THESE OFFICIAL RULES, YOU WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CHALLENGE, REGARDLESS OF YOUR POSITION ON THE LEADERBOARD. BY PARTICIPATING IN THE CHALLENGE OR OTHERWISE USING THE CHALLENGE RESOURCES, MATERIALS, AND/OR SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PUBLISHING TO THE LEADERBOARD, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE OFFICIAL RULES, INDEPENDENT OF YOUR ELIGIBILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CHALLENGE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE OFFICIAL RULES, YOU MAY NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE CHALLENGE OR OTHERWISE USE THE CHALLENGE RESOURCES, MATERIALS, OR SERVICES.
          

          2. Challenge Period: The Challenge starts at 10:00:00 p.m. Pacific Time (“PT") on March 15, 2022 and ends at 11:59:00 p.m. PT on May 31, 2023(the “Challenge Period"). All Submissions (defined below) must be received by Sponsor in the manner designated below between 10:00:00 a.m. PT on March 15, 2022 and 11:59:00 p.m. PT on May 31, 2023 (the “Submission Period") and meet all other requirements in these Official Rules to be eligible to win an award.
          

          3. How to Enter: The Challenge requires you to train machine learning models to accomplish various tasks and then submit their inference results for evaluation and placement on the leaderboards.
          Submission & Sign up
          To enter, complete the following steps during the Submission Period:
          
          Step 1 (Registration): (i) Log-in or create an EvalAI account at https://eval.ai; (ii) while logged into Your EvalAI account, visit https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/OpenLane-V2 and indicate your agreement to each challenge dataset License Agreement for Non-Commercial; and (iii) while logged into Your EvaiAI account, visit https://opendrivelab.com/AD23Challenge.html and indicate your agreement to these Official Rules. If you are in a team (defined below), each member of the team must individually complete these Step 1 instructions to register for the Challenge.
          
          Step 2 (Inference): Create and train a machine learning model to solve one of the three Challenge Tasks posted at the Challenge Site (“Challenge Tasks") using corresponding Dataset. Within each dataset, there is a Training, Validation, and Test Set. The Training and Validation Sets both have labels that You can use to train Your machine learning model (the Test Set ground truths will not be made available). You will run your trained machine learning model on the Test Set to create your own labels for the Test Set. You will then package those labels along with what is required in the Submission Guidelines and Restrictions section below and in the format specified at https://opendrivelab.com/AD23Challenge.html(an “Entry File").
          
          Step 3 (Submission): Upload Your Entry File(s) to (i) our Evaluation Server for the appropriate Challenge Task. Try to avoid using the same method name as methods from other entrants listed on the leaderboard. Do not submit multiple Entry Files for the same method with different object types. Instead, you should combine them into one Entry File.
          
          By entering the challenge, submitting anything to the leaderboard, or submitting (or being a member of a Team whose Team Leader (defined below) submits) an entry as instructed above (a “Submission"), You represent and warrant that: (i) You authorize the Submission and expressly agree to these Official Rules; (ii) the Submission complies with the each challenge dataset License (iii) the Submission complies with these Official Rules (including the Submission Guidelines and Restrictions below) and any additional requirements on the Challenge Site; (iv) the Submission does not violate any third-party rights, including copyrights, patents, trademark rights, trade secrets, or rights of privacy or publicity or contain unauthorized third-party trademarks or logos; (v) the Submission does not violate any applicable law, rule, policy, or regulation; (vi) any entity with which you are employed or affiliated (including as specified in the Submission, if applicable), and any other school and/or entity with which You are affiliated (if applicable), authorizes and does not prohibit or restrict Your participation in this Challenge in any way; (vii) the Submission does not supply untruthful, incomplete, inaccurate or misleading information; and (viii) the Submission is Your original creation and is owned 100%% by You, or, alternatively You have the full rights to grant the license and other rights that You grant to Sponsor in Section 10 below. Sponsor may choose to remove any Submission from the leaderboard or disqualify You from the Challenge if it believes that Your Submission fails to conform with the terms of these Official Rules, the  each challenge dataset License, or the Guidelines and Restrictions below. Upon completion of all required entry steps and compliance with these requirements, you will automatically receive one entry into the Challenge.
          
          Eligible participants may enter as one of the following categories of participants:
          
          Independent: When entering as an individual unaffiliated with any Team (defined below) or entity (“Independent"), only the single individual is participating in the Challenge. The Independent must complete the entry process as instructed in these Official Rules. The Independent will be required to sign the Declaration of Eligibility and Liability/Publicity Release and any other documents reasonably required by Sponsor (or Sponsor’s designee or affiliate) in order to be eligible to potentially win an award.
          
          Team: A team is either (i) an individual employed by or otherwise affiliated with an entity participating in this Challenge; or (ii) a group of no more than ten individuals, each of whom must meet all of the eligibility requirements in these Official Rules, and may include individuals employed by or otherwise affiliated with an entity participating in this Challenge (Your “Team"). FOR CLARITY, IF ANY MEMBER OF A TEAM FAILS TO MEET ALL OF THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS IN THESE OFFICIAL RULES, THE ENTIRE TEAM WILL BE DISQUALIFIED FROM WINNING ANY AWARD. Each Team must have a designated team lead (“Team Leader"), who is authorized to and will submit the Team’s Submission(s) on behalf of any affiliated entity/ies and/or other Team members making the Submission. If a Team is selected as a potential winner, each individual member of the Team will be required to sign the Declaration of Eligibility and Liability/Publicity Release and any other documents reasonably required by Sponsor (or Sponsor’s designee or affiliate) in order to be eligible to potentially win an award.
          
          Limits: An individual cannot be a member of more than one Team (or participate as an Independent and a member of a Team). An entity cannot be affiliated with more than one Team, unless the entity is an academic entity (e.g., a university). Each Independent or Team may have at most one account on the Evaluation Server. Each Independent or Team may provide Submissions for as many or as few of the Challenge Tasks as they would like. Submissions may be evaluated against the Test Set or Validation Set. Each Independent or Team may submit for evaluation against the Validation Set as many times as they like. However, Submissions evaluated against the Validation Set do not appear on the leaderboards and are not eligible for awards. Each Independent or Team may submit a Submission for evaluation against the Test Set three times per Challenge Task every 30 days during the Submission Period. If an Independent or Team is caught using multiple Google accounts for the purposes of circumventing this limit, Sponsor will remove such Independent’s or Team’s Submission and disqualify them from the Challenge.
          
          
          4. Identity of Entrant: All Submissions must be submitted by the individual entrant for an Independent entry, or the Team Leader for a Team entry. Bulk or automated entries will be disqualified (including entries made using any script, macro, bot, or promotional service). Multiple participants are not permitted to share the same email account. Any attempt to obtain additional entries through fraud, bots, or other illegitimate means will result in disqualification, at Sponsor’s discretion.
          
          If there is a dispute about the identity of the entrant, entries will be declared made by the authorized account holder of the email address associated with the Independent’s or Team Leader’s account through which the Submission is made. An “authorized account holder" means the natural person who is assigned to an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other organization (e.g., business, educational institution, etc.) that is responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted email address. Each potential winner may be required to provide Sponsor with proof that the potential winner is the authorized account holder of the email account associated with the winning Submission.
          

          5. Selection and Notification of Winner: Winners will be selected as follows: Phase 1 Judging: On or about May 23, 2022, Sponsor will test each Submission against the evaluation code (“Judging Code") for each Challenge Task. The Judging Code will attribute a score to each Submission, calculated from scores based upon the below criteria (a “Score"):
          
          
          Phase 2 Finalist Technical Report Submission: Each Finalist (in the case of a Team, the Team Leader) will be notified via email on or about June 1, 2022. To be deemed a potential winner and qualify for winning an award, each Finalist (in the case of a Team, the Team Leader) must (i) by June  3, 2022, respond to Sponsor’s email request by agreeing to submit a detailed description of their Submission’s method in the form of a technical report (a “Technical Report"); and (ii) by June 10, 2022, submit to Sponsor the Technical Report by email to workshop-e2e-ad@googlegroups.com. Technical Reports must be a PDF, 1-4 pages long, and contain enough information about the development of Your method to allow for reproducibility of Your Submission. Technical Reports will be made public and should not contain any confidential information. For questions about the necessary contents of Technical Reports, email workshop-e2e-ad@googlegroups.com. Technical Reports must (a) not supply untruthful, incomplete, inaccurate or misleading information; and (b) be Your original creation and be owned 100%% by You, or, alternatively You have the full rights to grant the license and other rights that You grant to Sponsor in Section 10 below. On or about June 13, 2022 Sponsor will review all Technical Reports. If the Technical Report (i) does not contain enough information to allow for reproducibility; or (ii) indicates that a Finalist may have cheated or that their Submission does not otherwise comply with these Official Rules, Sponsor may choose to remove the Submission or disqualify the Finalist from the Challenge and select an alternate Finalist in accordance with the Judging Code. Finalists whose Technical Reports comply with the above requirements and otherwise comply with these Official Rules will be deemed a Verified Finalist potential winner (“Verified Finalist") and notified by OpenDirveLab via email on or about June 13, 2022.
          
          Odds of winning an award depend on the number and quality of eligible entries received. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Sponsor may require each potential winner to sign and return, within seven days of being notified, an Affidavit of Eligibility and Liability/Publicity Release in order to claim their award. If (i) the attempted notification is returned as undeliverable without a forwarding address; (ii) any required documents are not returned within seven days, such as the Affidavit of Eligibility and Liability/Publicity Release; or (iii) if potential winner is otherwise unable to accept the award as stated, the award will be forfeited and will be awarded to an alternate eligible winner in accordance with the Judging Code. Only three alternate winners will be selected for each award.
          
          If, by reason of a print or other error (digital or otherwise), more awards are claimed than the number set forth in these Official Rules, the award(s) will be awarded to the Individual or Team with the highest scoring Submission in accordance with the above criteria from among all eligible claimants making purportedly valid claims to award the awards available.
          
          Verification of Potential Winners: EACH POTENTIAL WINNER IS SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION BY SPONSOR, WHOSE DECISIONS ARE FINAL AND BINDING IN ALL MATTERS RELATED TO THE CHALLENGE. AN ENTRANT IS NOT AN AWARD WINNER UNLESS AND UNTIL ENTRANT’S ELIGIBILITY HAS BEEN VERIFIED AND ENTRANT HAS BEEN NOTIFIED THAT VERIFICATION IS COMPLETE AND NO FURTHER ACTION IS NEEDED. IF SPONSOR DETERMINES IN ITS DISCRETION THAT A POTENTIAL WINNER INDIVIDUAL’S, TEAM MEMBER’S, OR TEAM’S PARTICIPATION IN THE CHALLENGE OR ACCEPTANCE OF AN AWARD MAY BRING DISREPUTE OR BE DETRIMENTAL TO SPONSOR (INCLUDING TO SPONSOR’S REPUTATION, BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS OR OTHER COMPANY INTERESTS) OR WAS PROHIBITED OR RESTRICTED BY ANY APPLICABLE LAW, RULE, OR REGULATION; BY ANY APPLICABLE EMPLOYER’S OR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION’S TERMS, RULES, OR POLICIES; OR BY THESE OFFICIAL RULES, THEN THE INDIVIDUAL OR TEAM ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH POTENTIAL WINNER WILL BE DISQUALIFIED AND AN ALTERNATE POTENTIAL WINNER WILL BE SELECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE JUDGING CODE.
          

          6. Award: Twelve Verified Finalists total will be selected to each receive a cash award. The specific amount is under consideration. 
          
          Cash awards will not be awarded to any employer, educational institution, or other entity affiliated with a Verified Finalist. Rather, cash awards will be awarded directly to the individual(s) making up a Verified Finalist regardless of their affiliation with any entity. In the case of a Team, the Team Leader must collect from their Team members and provide to Sponsor properly executed and completed tax forms, as appropriate, and such other forms, documents and information that Sponsor may reasonably request from the Team Leader or their Team members to confirm eligibility for an award and to comply with all applicable laws and Sponsor’s tax reporting and withholding obligations.
          
          Sponsor may choose in its discretion to invite select members of Verified Finalists to present their Submission method at the virtual Workshop on Autonomous Driving at CVPR 2023 on June 18, 2023 (invitees will be solely responsible for costs of attending the Workshop, which includes CVPR registration fees listed at https://cvpr2023.thecvf.com/).
          
          Award Restrictions: ALL FEDERAL, STATE, PROVINCIAL, AND LOCAL TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH THE RECEIPT OR USE OF ANY AWARD ARE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE WINNER. Awards are not transferable. No substitutions or exchanges of any award (including for cash) will be permitted, except that Sponsor reserves the right to substitute an award of comparable or greater value for any award.

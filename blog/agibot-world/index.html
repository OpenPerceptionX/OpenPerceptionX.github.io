            <p class="text-white w-full max-w-wide leading-loose">
                To effectively utilize web-scale heterogeneous videos alongside our high-quality AgiBot World dataset and enhance the policy's generalizability, we propose a hierarchical Vision-Language-Latent-Action (ViLLA) framework. Compared to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model where action is vision-language conditioned, the ViLLA model predicts latent action tokens, bridging the gap between image-text inputs and robot actions generated by the action expert. 
            </p>



            <h4 class="text-white w-full max-w-wide leading-loose ">
                Latent Action Model
            </h4>



            <p class="text-white w-full max-w-wide leading-loose">
                Despite considerable advancements in gathering diverse robot demonstrations, the volume of action-labeled robot data remains limited relative to web-scale datasets. To broaden the data pool by <b class="text-white">incorporating internet-scale human videos lacking action labels and cross-embodiment robot data</b>, we employ latent actions to model the inverse dynamics of consecutive frames. This approach enables the transfer of real-world dynamics from heterogeneous data sources into universal manipulation knowledge.
            </p>



            <p class="text-white w-full max-w-wide leading-loose">
                To extract latent actions from video frames, the latent action model is constructed around an inverse dynamics model-based encoder and a forward dynamics model-based decoder. The encoder employs a spatial-temporal transformer with casual temporal masks, while the decoder is a spatial transformer that takes the initial frame and discretized latent action tokens as input. The latent action tokens are quantized using a VQ-VAE objective.
            </p>



            <h4 class="text-white w-full max-w-wide leading-loose ">
                Latent Planner
            </h4>



            <p class="text-white w-full max-w-wide leading-loose">
                With the aim of establishing a solid foundation for scene and object understanding and general reasoning ability, the ViLLA model harnesses a VLM pre-trained on web-scale vision-language data and incorporates <b class="text-white">a latent planner for embodiment-agnostic planning within the latent action space</b>. We use InternVL2.5-2B as the VLM backbone due to its strong transfer learning capabilities. Multiview image observations are first encoded using InternViT before being projected into the language space. The latent planner consists of 24 transformer layers, which enable layer-by-layer conditioning from the VLM backbone with full bidirectional attention.
            </p>



            <p class="text-white w-full max-w-wide leading-loose">
                Specifically, given multiview input images (typically from the head, left wrist, and right wrist) along with a language instruction describing the ongoing task, the latent planner predicts latent action tokens, with supervision produced by the LAM encoder. Since the latent action space is orders of magnitude smaller than the discretized low-level actions used in OpenVLA, this approach also facilitates the efficient adaptation of general purpose VLMs into robot policies.
            </p>



            <h4 class="text-white w-full max-w-wide leading-loose ">
                Action Expert
            </h4>



            <p class="text-white w-full max-w-wide leading-loose">
                To achieve <b class="text-white">high-frequency and dexterous manipulation</b>, we integrate an action expert that utilizes a diffusion objective to model the continuous distribution of low-level actions. Although the action expert shares the same architectural framework as the latent planner, their objectives diverge: the latent planner generates discretized latent action tokens through masked language modeling, while the action expert regresses low-level actions via an iterative denoising process. Both expert modules are conditioned hierarchically on preceding modules, including the action expert itself, ensuring coherent integration and information flow within the dual-expert system.
            </p>



            <p class="text-white w-full max-w-wide leading-loose">
                During inference, the VLM, latent planner, and action expert are synergistically combined within the generalist policy GO-1, which initially predicts k latent action tokens and subsequently conditions the denoising process to produce the final control signals.

GO-1 significantly outperforms RDT, particularly in tasks such as “Pour Water”, which demands robustness to object positions, and “Restock Beverage”, which requires visual robustness and instruction following capabilities.

We evaluate the out-of-the-box performance of resulting policies on four seen tasks in pre-training the.

                We introduce AgiBot World, an open-source ecosystem aimed at democratizing access to large-scale, high-quality robot learning datasets. It is complete with toolchains and foundation models to advance embodied general intelligence through community collaboration. Our dataset distinguishes itself through unparalleled scale, diversity, and quality, underpinned by carefully crafted tasks. 
            </p>



            <p class="text-white w-full max-w-wide leading-loose">
                Policy learning evaluations confirm AgiBot World’s value in enhancing performance and generalizability. To further explore its impact, we develop GO-1, a generalist policy utilizing latent actions for webscale pre-training. GO-1 excels in real-world complex tasks, outperforming existing generalist policies and demonstrating scalable performance with increased data volume.

                We invite the broader community to collaborate in fostering an ecosystem and maximizing the potential of our extensive dataset.

                To effectively utilize our high-quality AgiBot World dataset and enhance the policy’s generalizability, we propose a hierarchical Vision-Language-Latent-Action (ViLLA) framework with three training stages. Compared to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model where action is vision-language conditioned, the ViLLA model predicts latent action tokens, conditioned on the generation of subsequent robot control actions. In Stage 1, we project consecutive images into a latent action space by training an encoder-decoder latent action model(LAM) on internet-scale heterogeneous data. This allows the latent action to serve as an intermediate representation, bridging the gap between general image-text inputs and robotic actions. In Stage 2, these latent actions act as pseudolabels for the latent planner, facilitating embodiment-agnostic long-horizon planning and leveraging the generalizability of the pre-trained VLM. Finally, in Stage 3, we introduce the action expert and jointly train it with the latent planner to support the learning of dexterous manipulation.

                New Scaling for Humanoid Robotics
            </h4>



            <p class="text-white w-full max-w-wide leading-loose">
                The home presents robotics' greatest challenge. Unlike controlled industrial settings, homes are filled with countless objects–delicate glassware, crumpled clothing, scattered toys–each with unpredictable shapes, sizes, colors, and textures. For robots to be useful in households, they will need to be capable of generating intelligent new behaviors on-demand, especially for objects they've never seen before.
            </p>



            <p class="text-white w-full max-w-wide leading-loose">
                The current state of robotics will not scale to the home without a step change. Teaching robots even a single new behavior currently requires substantial human effort: either hours of PhD-level expert manual programming or thousands of demonstrations. Both are prohibitively expensive when we consider how vast the problem of the home truly is.
